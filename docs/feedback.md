Hello Alice,

I would add more to your description
What I have is: "BYU-Idaho student studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning | Seeking interships in Data Analysis or in IT"
I see this more like a resume to show your projects and less to show job experience, kind of like LinkedIn
